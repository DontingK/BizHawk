[HEAD]

[c2a5b37799 CPP] Update contributing guide for the new Lua setup

[bc12fcca87 Yoshi] Minor revision to EmuHawk contribution guide

[c7c5ed229d CPP] add pc2 extension for wonderswan
these are pocket challenge v2 roms, which is some handheld system which is actually just a wonderswan inside so these roms work anyways with cygne

[91ce98ef12 CPP] better handle lua on linux, be compatible with lua 5.3 (we don't actually use any API exclusive to 5.4 so no real change in this case)

[66c19cfcb2 natt] Support marshalling arrays of length 0 through BizInvoker
Such arrays will be marshalled with valid and unique pointers that can be compared but not read from or written to.

[7703ee5f37 Yoshi] Refactor `IGameboyCommon.IsCGBMode`

[339915c013 CPP] check-in NLua to main repo combine NLua with KeraLua (KeraLua is "gone" now I guess) make it use the BizInvoker (so now it can properly handle the liblua5.4.so and lua54.dll names differing), also delete the liblua54.so. minor speedup when creating a new empty table make lua default to UTF8 internally, so we don't need to manually change the state's encoding

[a1da5753ee CPP] check-in NLua to main repo combine NLua with KeraLua (KeraLua is "gone" now I guess) make it use the BizInvoker (so now it can properly handle the liblua5.4.so and lua54.dll names differing), also delete the liblua54.so. minor speedup when creating a new empty table make lua default to UTF8 internally, so we don't need to manually change the state's encoding

[767e30eee5 Yoshi] Also rename bundled CPC firmware files (see #3494)
fixes 5be8b0aab

[8d5f7b5478 CPP] make selecting user shaders not crash with the default empty string path Path.GetDirectoryName throws if it is handed an empty string apparently

[a680739c6e Yoshi] Rename bundled ZX Spectrum firmware file (resolves #3494)
fixes 5be8b0aab

[2989a73430 CPP] workaround ares state size being blown up, fix compilation issue in some gcc versions

[2187602dc1 CPP] fix Package.sh too fixes 91e400bdd9959fff3c6f7cc9f2e9a4be255603c8

[91e400bdd9 CPP] fix QuickTestBuildAndPackage to include the "overlay" folder (meant for RetroAchievements stuff)

[767cc9059d CPP] Improve handling of RA http requests, add some handling in case RA sound files are missing. Normally this shouldn't be needed as docs specify if the wav file fails to load it plays the default beep sound, except actually it just throws in practice??? The 2.9 rcs apparently have the "overlay" folder missing, so the sound files aren't present. I'm assuming there's some issue with build scripts there for releases...

[27f6800d45 CPP] fix #3489 (InitializeWork is called by itself for each gamedb file #include'd, so the event would have been set once the first gamedb file is loaded, oops), do some other cleanup here

[b3c7f0fa48 CPP] IPlatformLuaLibEnv -> ILuaLibraries / Win32LuaLibraries -> LuaLibraries, cleanup usage of it, fix doc error in client.gettool

[f101cb5a54 Yoshi] Additional corrections to newly-added Lua documentation
fixes 49cd836e1, c7781d1c1

[c7781d1c17 Yoshi] Add Lua migration helper library for bitwise ops
see 49cd836e1, #3485
put `bit = (require "migration_helpers").EmuHawk_pre_2_9_bit();` at top of file
can now easily add helpers for migrating from other emulators

[9e4836d300 CPP] libretro handling cleanup, reorg some of this, fix some input cases, better domain names funsie found in this cleanup: can't use `in` params with the BizInvoker as it doesn't like the read only semantics (results in some exception in CreateType)

[64d693e63f CPP] call retro_unload_game before retro_deinit (libretro api specifies retro_unload_game be called before retro_deinit, in practice cores don't really care but best fix this)

[29443dae49 CPP] fix #3484

[c4f4c793da Yoshi] Remove unused `IPlatformLuaLibEnv` implementation

[5197c36a5d Yoshi] Remove `[Lua*StringParam]` as they're no longer relevant
fixes 45fbdb484

[5c0143d6f6 Yoshi] Minor corrections to newly-added Lua documentation
fixes 1452f831a, 82c3b471a, b687dea1b, 49cd836e1

[01ab9416b5 kalimag] Make script paths in .luases relative to .luases path
Restore behavior before 99dc0e03df4c4cd20420507a06dd9987cbdf7140

[7fdc3f992d Yoshi] Propagate success through to caller for movie load/restart

[e0a7a39b0d Yoshi] Have `IMovieApi.Stop` implementation use `MainForm.StopMovie`

[596e8d9198 kalimag] Call `onexit` and cleanup when removing lua script

[50fc7e28da kalimag] Make "Stop all scripts" behave the same as toggling them off

[817b258a79 kalimag] Remove relative path manipulation in `LuaConsole`

[f625771cd0 kalimag] Don't create FileSystemWatcher for missing directories

[cf2b83b102 kalimag] Disable lua script if loading fails

[bd53807b0f kalimag] Store `LuaFile` `FileSystemWatcher` in dictionary
Avoid path string comparisons, `FileSystemWatcher` events may format relative paths differently

[6aa7c48402 kalimag] Update Lua registered functions window after restart
Make registered functions window show functions for new LuaImp after core restart/reopening the Lua console

[ee66faba0b kalimag] Clean up old LuaImp before creating new one
Prevents memory/resource leak
Causes open forms to be closed on core restart

[3a70fb65f8 kalimag] Refactor disabling Lua script into separate method

[7c7ac64ae6 kalimag] Stop discarding Lua session save directory
Previously any path would into ".\foo.luases" and be saved in exe dir

Make FSW invoke the entire event handler on main thread.
Avoids theoretical race condition and thread safety issues with the linq query.

[733a8bee88 kalimag] Dispose FileSystemWatchers in LuaConsole

[28d6415190 kalimag] Remove running scripts before loading session
Clean up scripts instead of just clearing script list

[cc10de4033 kalimag] Refactor removing Lua scripts into separate method

[564a1e4a67 kalimag] Remove obsolete `LuaConsole.RunLuaScripts`
Method is mostly a duplicate of `EnableLuaFile`, only called when loading a session or an already loaded script.
In either case it didn't actually start the scripts due to an inverted condition, and would stop running scripts without doing the required cleanup.

[5d143ca879 kalimag] Properly start scripts after loading Lua session
Previously, scripts would display as enabled but not actually run until toggled off and on.

[0effd435f6 kalimag] Fix issues when opening same Lua script multiple times

[14e713837b kalimag] Change remaining `Config.DisableLuaScriptsOnLoad` refs to Settings
Resolve inconsistent use of duplicate property on `Config` and `LuaConsoleSettings`, finishes partial refactoring from 324a50a
This will effectively reset this setting to default in existing configs.

[102874e480 Yoshi] Fix N64 header detection being swapped (fixes #3477)
fixes abeaa2a10
how ironic

[62f6f3b471 Yoshi] Fix Win32LuaLibraries init'ing incorrectly on `DeveloperBuild = false`

[b04260bee7 CPP] fix unwrapped lua exceptions not being correctly thrown

[b687dea1b0 CPP] change every IntPtr<->int cast to IntPtr<->long. we got 64 bit integers with lua now, and a pointer is 64 bits, so might avoid some dumb bug due to truncations and some ungodly amount of ram being used TODO: see if we can skip this cast nonsense. the lua tests indicate IntPtr should pass through fine, being considered "userdata", probably better so the user can't just pass raw numbers for the handle.

[bc79664461 CPP] fix implicit lua number to .net conversion fix .net exceptions not halting the running script fix inconsistency with stdout and lua console printing errors, both should end in a newline now print the inner exception of a lua exception (i.e. the .net extension) if possible

[eb00019c86 CPP] fix passing numbers for string args in .net lua functions (old engine had this behavior, granted "bad user" if they relied on this), add appropriate test fix passing sbyte/char as args, add appropriate tests cleanup the lua auto unlock hack, using a nice ref struct + dispose to handle it

[920682688b CPP] deprecate lua bit functions which have direct operator counterparts in new lua

[dcd570bf87 CPP] fix mainmemory.write_bytes_as_dict

[abeaa2a106 Yoshi] Be less lazy about N64 header detection in byteswapper
fixes 82c3b471a, 9660c16a0

[9660c16a0a CPP] fix N64 roms coming through multidisk bundler in ares

[84d2866f53 Yoshi] Clean up usage of `LuaFile.Enabled`/`Paused`

[f798021bba CPP] CloseRom acts like rebooting the core, so make it just reset Lua libs (more properly fixes #3226 without any yield nonsense) Slight revert of 2efae13af4f9dd5ca233a31b9085195829f6a513 (still want to set running scripts as it's used later) Fix detaching registered functions (old logic was broken, Stop would null out the LuaRef used for creating the new dummy thread for the detached function. best solution i've come up with is to simply pass a callback over for creating the thread, nicely encapsulating that functionality) Various cleanups, don't need VS complaining about old pattern matching code here anymore...

[51f01efdc4 CPP] Properly handle errors when running a lua script, using Resume/Yield methods added to the LuaThread class (see https://github.com/TASEmulators/NLua/commit/f904fa0d53b06c67dd8e9b409dcbb9fa8aa721f2)

[2efae13af4 CPP] prevent some NREs occurring with the new Lua stuff

[42455ac4a3 Yoshi] Fix syntax in `defctrl.json` and remove empty objects

[6381448472 Yoshi] decimal is not floating-point
fixes fdbb34dff

[5603e5ac01 Yoshi] Reorder items in Tools menu

[3dcc3ff89f Yoshi] Improve handling of exceptions thrown in `Form.Load` handlers
obviously only benefits forms inheriting `FormBase`

[9393e1b764 CPP] Fix #3417 and improve handling of `default.tasproj` (squashed PR #3462)
* Fix #3417 and improve handling of default.tasproj
* expose SetMovieController in the MovieSession interface (please don't rely on it anywhere else)
* don't use this explicit public in the interface
(is this mentioned anywhere? i assume this is proper style)
* use this helper function

[e269bfd49f adelikat] Log window - when copying pasting "MD5:2345" and Sha1, strip the md5 and sha1 out.  I just want the number if I'm copying pasting the single line.  If someone finds this objectionable, feel free to revert, but this savesme a lot of time

[683aa263a0 Yoshi] Include `ControllerDefinition._orderedControls` in clone ctor
I don't think this is used, but as the caching was new in 2.8, going to include
this just in case

[0711c2b1d6 Yoshi] Also downcase OdysseyÂ² gamedb filename in import line
fixes 5a4dc9fd8

[248e87b6d1 CPP] try to load a different core if an autodetected mame rom ends up failing to load

[5a4dc9fd88 Yoshi] Downcase OdysseyÂ² gamedb filename to match others

[937872eaf6 Yoshi] Fix malformed PC Engine gamedb entry

0x1A is MBC5+RAM, 0x1B is MBC5+RAM+BATTERY

[0bd182e6cc CPP] properly handle "NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN" mame rom hashes (note, these roms are not actually in the romset, so the singular hash in movies doesn't have to be affected here)

[2804ad3041 CPP] fix crashes in mame due to bad single thread handling

[44944e1d70 CPP] more simple string and double handling, allow SaveRAM usage with different bios files

[d0266816a5 CPP] Fix #3448. Support MAME 7z romsets

[5ae4470466 CPP] Correct floating point arg support with msabi<->sysv adapter
While msabi and sysv do agree what to do with floating point args for 4 floating point args (pass in xmm0-4), they dont agree what to do with mixing
msabi will choose the register corresponding with argument position. so if you have (int foo, float bar), bar will use xmm1
sysv instead will choose the first register available in the group. so with the previous example, you instead have bar using xmm0
the simple solution is to simply prohibit mixed args for now. maybe someday we could support mixing, but that's probably overkill (best use a struct at that point)

[62c3b4b8e3 CPP] Use a small dll for handling the msabi<->sysv adapter (#3451)
make a small dll for handling the msabi<->sysv adapter, using only assembly (taken from generated optimized rustc output) and handcrafted unwind information (c# exceptions in a callback seem to work fine in testing)
additionally, allow floating point arguments. this really only needs to occur on the c# side. msabi and sysv agree on the first 4 floating point args and for returns, so no work actually has to be done adapting these
with assembly being used, we can guarantee rax will not be stomped by compiler whims (and avoid potential floating point args from being trashed)

[eec86ad81a CPP] Use actual doubles for figuring out aspect ratio Fixes issues when mame sends over < 1 bounds which round down to 0 with a long cast (resulting in div by 0 exceptions) Also fix some oopsies with incorrect function signatures. Remove MAME string docs as they aren't really relevant anymore, as only MameGetString handles lua string handling now

[64044845a6 CPP] resolve erroneous LibMAME errors due to mame_lua_get_string returning nullptr with an empty string (now will only do so on an error) add back in mame_lua_get_double, to be used to resolve other issues (c# code pending...)

[fd2772707b Yoshi] Update `forms.drawImageRegion` documentation with a diagram
only embeds on TASVideos Wiki, which I held off on updating because there are a
lot of changes and we can do them all at once

[8ee75879e6 CPP] Rework MAME integration a bit
The periodic callback is now used as a way to service "commands" sent from the main thread
Upon servicing a command, the mame thread will set the current command to NO_CMD then wait for the main thread allow the mame thread to continue
During this wait, the main thread may optionally set the next command (done here for STEP -> VIDEO), ensuring the next callback will service that command
A dummy "WAIT" command can be sent to trigger this waiting behavior, allowing the main thread to safely touch mame while the mame thread is frozen (important for mem accesses and probably savestates?)
A/V sync is also reworked. We can assume that 1/50 of a second worth of samples will be sent each sound callback. We can also assume 1/FPS of a second worth of time will be advanced each frame advance
So, we can just give hawk 1/FPS worth of samples every GetSamplesSync, if they are available. If we have less (probable on first few frames), we'll just give all the samples, and hope it balances out later.

[5e34dc6166 CPP] Always savestate expansion pak regardless of settings.
All the disable expansion pak setting actually does is tell the game the expansion pak is not available.
However, not all games actually abide by this, some will use the expansion pak area anyways.
Video plugins also end up just using a "segfault test" to determine if the expansion pak is present or not
So video plugins may use the expansion pak area too
This ends up causing savestates sometimes just crashing the game if the expansion pak ends up used
Resolves #3092, other state issues might be solved with this (I suspect #3328 is caused by this)

Full hash of a ~731MB disc took only ~369 ms with this, and the generic CRC32 isn't so far behind at ~659 ms
SHA1 should perform 4x faster if the user's CPU supports the SHA instructions.
