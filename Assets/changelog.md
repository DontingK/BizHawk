[bc12fcca87 Yoshi] Minor revision to EmuHawk contribution guide

[00d450075e CPP] oops forgot a colon here

[c7c5ed229d CPP] add pc2 extension for wonderswan
these are pocket challenge v2 roms, which is some handheld system which is actually just a wonderswan inside so these roms work anyways with cygne

[2c75e9bf96 CPP] remove this unneeded using of System.Drawing (i don't know how that got here)

[91ce98ef12 CPP] better handle lua on linux, be compatible with lua 5.3 (we don't actually use any API exclusive to 5.4 so no real change in this case)

[603530d540 Morilli] set gcAllowVeryLargeObjects to allow 2GB+ arrays

[79857a3b71 Morilli] Revert "make a new "FixedGrowthList" and use it for the StringLogs"
This reverts commit da5fae0b01abbdcb91a5f65c8a7e03b1600b4aef.

[66c19cfcb2 natt] Support marshalling arrays of length 0 through BizInvoker
Such arrays will be marshalled with valid and unique pointers that can be compared but not read from or written to.

[5b0fe947df CPP] fix #3498

fixes 96cc3f874558dd8ed2048c889005437018e9bb57
apparently this was only an issue in sgb?

[aa0e2d6a5f Yoshi] Use new CartRAM domain name in GBHawk's CDL impl. (fixes #3497)
fixes 7e00b7892

[cee263e272 CPP] oops didn't mean to checkin this experiment (it doesn't do anything actually)

[339915c013 CPP] check-in NLua to main repo combine NLua with KeraLua (KeraLua is "gone" now I guess) make it use the BizInvoker (so now it can properly handle the liblua5.4.so and lua54.dll names differing), also delete the liblua54.so. minor speedup when creating a new empty table make lua default to UTF8 internally, so we don't need to manually change the state's encoding

[a1da5753ee CPP] check-in NLua to main repo combine NLua with KeraLua (KeraLua is "gone" now I guess) make it use the BizInvoker (so now it can properly handle the liblua5.4.so and lua54.dll names differing), also delete the liblua54.so. minor speedup when creating a new empty table make lua default to UTF8 internally, so we don't need to manually change the state's encoding

[55fdcbb3d1 Morilli] Don't set modifiers for key release events
this fixes a bug in 1df6ce4e38946564765dab9227ed093b5f33812f, where an incorrect modifier state could be set, causing the release event to not actually release the key. I also don't see a reason to not just not set modifiers.
For example: "Hold Tab", "Hold Shift", "Release Tab" would send a "Release:Shift+Tab" event which failed to release Tab, even though that key was initially pressed without Shift.
So, instead of trying to match the right modifiers and keys just send the released key without modifier state and let the Receive() function do the work.

[767e30eee5 Yoshi] Also rename bundled CPC firmware files (see #3494)
fixes 5be8b0aab

[8d5f7b5478 CPP] make selecting user shaders not crash with the default empty string path Path.GetDirectoryName throws if it is handed an empty string apparently

fixes 5be8b0aab

[3bb785a470 CPP] oops, apparently didn't commit the build here

[58beef8a46 CPP] remove speex use in melonDS (see 5f0e6a2242c236086f7fe9a6e498941835312d2c for unmanaged side changes)

[5f0e6a2242 CPP] updae melonds, rework the audio so it is internally resampled with blip_buf (also allows for avoiding some copying, also corrects some minor audio defects)

[5e9e9ac289 CPP] remove libspeexdsp use in old bsnes core

[c794d90878 Yoshi] Revert switch to system-wide Lua install on Linux
reverts ab355d469 and 25795d237

[05962cfd93 CPP] more proper fix for compilation issue with some gcc versions with ares fixes 2989a73430f2677e5a0fbbfceedb8dedbd9bfb11

[2989a73430 CPP] workaround ares state size being blown up, fix compilation issue in some gcc versions

[91e400bdd9 CPP] fix QuickTestBuildAndPackage to include the "overlay" folder (meant for RetroAchievements stuff)

[767cc9059d CPP] Improve handling of RA http requests, add some handling in case RA sound files are missing. Normally this shouldn't be needed as docs specify if the wav file fails to load it plays the default beep sound, except actually it just throws in practice??? The 2.9 rcs apparently have the "overlay" folder missing, so the sound files aren't present. I'm assuming there's some issue with build scripts there for releases...

[f3ee3e7956 CPP] mGBA update, various cleanups and some reorg

[f6503adfb8 adelikat] Update virtualpads immediate when the movie status changes, huge improvement when using tastudio and virtualpad together as the record checkbox toggle now changes the readonly status of the pad

see https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes/issues/256 or https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24087 for context

[74b37ab947 Morilli] BSNESv115+: apply patch to fix CPUMSC reset test
see https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes/issues/235
this patch fixes the test, but its correctness needs to be verified against real hardware

[b0af99a68a Morilli] BSNESv115+: pull upstream
43e42b2dcaf84c41d09c49745d82f8515e4f7771: simplify SA1 division
c0c60c83a84a49d4a2b822a0491cb258a3c5b98a: fix justifier controller

[27f6800d45 CPP] fix #3489 (InitializeWork is called by itself for each gamedb file #include'd, so the event would have been set once the first gamedb file is loaded, oops), do some other cleanup here

[b3c7f0fa48 CPP] IPlatformLuaLibEnv -> ILuaLibraries / Win32LuaLibraries -> LuaLibraries, cleanup usage of it, fix doc error in client.gettool

can now easily add helpers for migrating from other emulators

[9e4836d300 CPP] libretro handling cleanup, reorg some of this, fix some input cases, better domain names funsie found in this cleanup: can't use `in` params with the BizInvoker as it doesn't like the read only semantics (results in some exception in CreateType)

[dc774ed8be feos] update EWJ2 script too

[7b7cea8bcf feos] update gargoyles script to work with new lua

[64d693e63f CPP] call retro_unload_game before retro_deinit (libretro api specifies retro_unload_game be called before retro_deinit, in practice cores don't really care but best fix this)

[29443dae49 CPP] fix #3484

[c4f4c793da Yoshi] Remove unused `IPlatformLuaLibEnv` implementation

[5197c36a5d Yoshi] Remove `[Lua*StringParam]` as they're no longer relevant

[f625771cd0 kalimag] Don't create FileSystemWatcher for missing directories

[cf2b83b102 kalimag] Disable lua script if loading fails

[bd53807b0f kalimag] Store `LuaFile` `FileSystemWatcher` in dictionary
Avoid path string comparisons, `FileSystemWatcher` events may format relative paths differently

Prevents memory/resource leak
Causes open forms to be closed on core restart

[3a70fb65f8 kalimag] Refactor disabling Lua script into separate method

[7c7ac64ae6 kalimag] Stop discarding Lua session save directory
Previously any path would into ".\foo.luases" and be saved in exe dir

[9ee788195a kalimag] Improve Lua `FileSystemWatcher` thread safety
Make FSW invoke the entire event handler on main thread.
Avoids theoretical race condition and thread safety issues with the linq query.

[28d6415190 kalimag] Remove running scripts before loading session
Clean up scripts instead of just clearing script list

[cc10de4033 kalimag] Refactor removing Lua scripts into separate method

[564a1e4a67 kalimag] Remove obsolete `LuaConsole.RunLuaScripts`
Method is mostly a duplicate of `EnableLuaFile`, only called when loading a session or an already loaded script.
In either case it didn't actually start the scripts due to an inverted condition, and would stop running scripts without doing the required cleanup.

[5d143ca879 kalimag] Properly start scripts after loading Lua session
Previously, scripts would display as enabled but not actually run until toggled off and on.

[0effd435f6 kalimag] Fix issues when opening same Lua script multiple times

[14e713837b kalimag] Change remaining `Config.DisableLuaScriptsOnLoad` refs to Settings
Resolve inconsistent use of duplicate property on `Config` and `LuaConsoleSettings`, finishes partial refactoring from 324a50a
This will effectively reset this setting to default in existing configs.

[102874e480 Yoshi] Fix N64 header detection being swapped (fixes #3477)
fixes abeaa2a10
how ironic

[62f6f3b471 Yoshi] Fix Win32LuaLibraries init'ing incorrectly on `DeveloperBuild = false`

[b04260bee7 CPP] fix unwrapped lua exceptions not being correctly thrown

[5e6c4a2bbd Morilli] fix justifier controller never working oops

[96cc3f8745 Morilli] BSNESv115: implement an extended gamepad controller with 4 extra buttons
this is a breaking change for existing movies, but only when a non-gamepad controller was used, which is rare

[339994c5a7 CPP] change these to using var

[b687dea1b0 CPP] change every IntPtr<->int cast to IntPtr<->long. we got 64 bit integers with lua now, and a pointer is 64 bits, so might avoid some dumb bug due to truncations and some ungodly amount of ram being used TODO: see if we can skip this cast nonsense. the lua tests indicate IntPtr should pass through fine, being considered "userdata", probably better so the user can't just pass raw numbers for the handle.

[bc79664461 CPP] fix implicit lua number to .net conversion fix .net exceptions not halting the running script fix inconsistency with stdout and lua console printing errors, both should end in a newline now print the inner exception of a lua exception (i.e. the .net extension) if possible

[eb00019c86 CPP] fix passing numbers for string args in .net lua functions (old engine had this behavior, granted "bad user" if they relied on this), add appropriate test fix passing sbyte/char as args, add appropriate tests cleanup the lua auto unlock hack, using a nice ref struct + dispose to handle it

[920682688b CPP] deprecate lua bit functions which have direct operator counterparts in new lua

[dcd570bf87 CPP] fix mainmemory.write_bytes_as_dict

[4a49fc174b Morilli] Improve LsmvImport in numerous ways
- previously, every second frame was empty (lol), since 2016 i believe
- now imports as (sub)bsnes115 movie instead of bsnes, allowing to import subframe inputs and delayed resets
- imports controller types correct(er)ly

[10ba45d462 Morilli] BSNESv115+: actually provide IBoardInfo properly

[abeaa2a106 Yoshi] Be less lazy about N64 header detection in byteswapper
fixes 82c3b471a, 9660c16a0

[9660c16a0a CPP] fix N64 roms coming through multidisk bundler in ares

[3dd36f5f07 CPP] revert the explicit try/finally use for PeekByte/PokeByte monitor domain methods, testing seems to show the ref struct use makes EnterExit allocation (now forced to the stack) a non-issue performance wise

[f01463e2b3 CPP] Convert EnterExitWrapper to a readonly ref struct, this should be a speedup in all cases. Will need to experiment to see if this mean the try/finally from #3296 can be avoided

[c2d5a9c931 Yoshi] Banish empty conditional blocks

[84d2866f53 Yoshi] Clean up usage of `LuaFile.Enabled`/`Paused`

[f798021bba CPP] CloseRom acts like rebooting the core, so make it just reset Lua libs (more properly fixes #3226 without any yield nonsense) Slight revert of 2efae13af4f9dd5ca233a31b9085195829f6a513 (still want to set running scripts as it's used later) Fix detaching registered functions (old logic was broken, Stop would null out the LuaRef used for creating the new dummy thread for the detached function. best solution i've come up with is to simply pass a callback over for creating the thread, nicely encapsulating that functionality) Various cleanups, don't need VS complaining about old pattern matching code here anymore...

[15b2264cb4 CPP] Use LuaThread Yield here instead of directly using LuaState's

[51f01efdc4 CPP] Properly handle errors when running a lua script, using Resume/Yield methods added to the LuaThread class (see https://github.com/TASEmulators/NLua/commit/f904fa0d53b06c67dd8e9b409dcbb9fa8aa721f2)

[ae11dcc6af Morilli] replace default bsnes with bsnes115

[2efae13af4 CPP] prevent some NREs occurring with the new Lua stuff

[42455ac4a3 Yoshi] Fix syntax in `defctrl.json` and remove empty objects

[6381448472 Yoshi] decimal is not floating-point

[da5fae0b01 CPP] make a new "FixedGrowthList" and use it for the StringLogs
this is mostly to workaround OOM issues with VERY large movies (>134217728 frames).
so large just the list of string references is "too big" and exceeds the .net 2GB limit.
even the on disk method fails here, as the offsets list (note, long and reference are the same size) becomes too big
this probably gives a bit of speedup for "normal" movies, as the generous 16MB growth amount would likely be plenty for the movie, although i haven't test this much

[5ae4470466 CPP] Correct floating point arg support with msabi<->sysv adapter
While msabi and sysv do agree what to do with floating point args for 4 floating point args (pass in xmm0-4), they dont agree what to do with mixing
msabi will choose the register corresponding with argument position. so if you have (int foo, float bar), bar will use xmm1
sysv instead will choose the first register available in the group. so with the previous example, you instead have bar using xmm0
the simple solution is to simply prohibit mixed args for now. maybe someday we could support mixing, but that's probably overkill (best use a struct at that point)

[62c3b4b8e3 CPP] Use a small dll for handling the msabi<->sysv adapter (#3451)
make a small dll for handling the msabi<->sysv adapter, using only assembly (taken from generated optimized rustc output) and handcrafted unwind information (c# exceptions in a callback seem to work fine in testing)
additionally, allow floating point arguments. this really only needs to occur on the c# side. msabi and sysv agree on the first 4 floating point args and for returns, so no work actually has to be done adapting these
with assembly being used, we can guarantee rax will not be stomped by compiler whims (and avoid potential floating point args from being trashed)

[a0de42b1b3 CPP] remove struct hack, it's not actually needed out double is System.Double& while double is System.Double, so it doesn't actually trip paramenter verifier

[8ee75879e6 CPP] Rework MAME integration a bit
The periodic callback is now used as a way to service "commands" sent from the main thread
Upon servicing a command, the mame thread will set the current command to NO_CMD then wait for the main thread allow the mame thread to continue
During this wait, the main thread may optionally set the next command (done here for STEP -> VIDEO), ensuring the next callback will service that command
A dummy "WAIT" command can be sent to trigger this waiting behavior, allowing the main thread to safely touch mame while the mame thread is frozen (important for mem accesses and probably savestates?)
A/V sync is also reworked. We can assume that 1/50 of a second worth of samples will be sent each sound callback. We can also assume 1/FPS of a second worth of time will be advanced each frame advance
So, we can just give hawk 1/FPS worth of samples every GetSamplesSync, if they are available. If we have less (probable on first few frames), we'll just give all the samples, and hope it balances out later.

[5e34dc6166 CPP] Always savestate expansion pak regardless of settings.
All the disable expansion pak setting actually does is tell the game the expansion pak is not available.
However, not all games actually abide by this, some will use the expansion pak area anyways.
Video plugins also end up just using a "segfault test" to determine if the expansion pak is present or not
So video plugins may use the expansion pak area too
This ends up causing savestates sometimes just crashing the game if the expansion pak ends up used
Resolves #3092, other state issues might be solved with this (I suspect #3328 is caused by this)

* Slightly rework frame advance logic. The main intent here is to prevent a case where two frames are ran within a single "frame." The current code probably wouldn't crash due to that, but best not to do that.
Also make SGB work here. A bit of a joke since you really can only abuse it for subframe resets, but might as well especially with the settings implying it's possible (and someone is bound to complain).

[5be8b0aab9 CPP] Zstd Compression (#3345)
Deflate compression in rewinder is now zstd compression
Binary blobs in zip files are zstd compressed (text is uncompresed for user ease).
All wbx cores and resources are re-compressed with zstd, wbx build scripts are changed to account for this. Shaves off a bit with download size and it's faster to decompress to.

[32e8afcedc CPP] Implement hardware accelerated CRC32 and SHA1, using them if possible (#3348)
* Implement hardware accelerated CRC32 and SHA1, use them if possible.
CRC32's generic function is also replaced with zlib's as it is much more performant than our implementation
Full hash of a ~731MB disc took only ~369 ms with this, and the generic CRC32 isn't so far behind at ~659 ms
SHA1 should perform 4x faster if the user's CPU supports the SHA instructions.

1b8b4b492623f25b0aa322901c2009de9071ebb4 removed an important bit of logic that set `_triggerAutoRestore` to false in certain cases. but simply putting the same line back there doesn't fix the problem, probably due to major refactorings over the years. so I'm adding it right into `GoToLastEmulatedFrameIfNecessary()` which is still called properly when it's needed. `JumpToGreenzone()` is kinda redundant now since it contains the same check, but it's used from the outside, and I didn't feel like refactoring this part.
